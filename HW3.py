# import the random module for use in this program
import random

# Create the class Crystal_Ball
class Crystal_Ball:

    # create the constructor (__init__) method
    # it takes as input: a list of possible predictions
    # it takes as input: a list of possible names
    # it sets this object's prediction_list (instance variable) to the passed list of possible predictions
    # it sets this object's name_list (instance variable) to the passed list of possible names
    # it sets this object's prediction_history_list (instance variable) to an empty list
    # it sets this object's name_history_list (instance variable) to an empty list

    # create the __str__ method
    # It should return a string with all the predictions
    # in prediction_list separated by commas

    # create the predict method that takes a name
    # it randomly picks an index from 0 to the number of items in the prediction_list minus one
    # it adds that index to the end of the prediction_history_list
    # it randomly picks an index from 0 to the number of items in the name_list minus one
    # it adds that index to the end of the name_history_list
    # It adds the passed name to the name_list
    # it returns a string with the prediction at the picked index followed by the name at the name index

    # create the check_name method that takes a name
    # it checks if the name is in the name_list and if so returns
    #         "I already have that name!‚Äù
    # Otherwise it returns the prediction from predict

    # create the print_history method
    # prints "[prediction index] prediction - [name index] name" for each of the indices in the prediction_history_list
    # from the first to the last with each on a single line.  If there are not items in the
    # prediction_history_list it prints "None yet"
    # it does not return anything!

    # EXTRA POINTS
    # create the most_frequent method
    # it takes as input:
    #    a number, n. Ex: 200
    # it generates a random response n times by calling predict.
    # It prints the counts for each prediction index, and
    # prints the most frequently occurring prediction index and prediction
